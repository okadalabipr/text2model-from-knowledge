Given the current state of a list and a prompt, extrapolate as many reactions of molecules as possible from the prompt and update the list. Every line in the list contains gene names which act as the reactants and type of reaction of the left and products on the right, connected with different types of arrows depending on the reversibility of the reaction. The available reactions are:
A dimerizes <--> A2
A binds B <--> AB
AB dissociates to A and B
uA is phosphorylated --> pA
pA is dephosphorylated --> uA
B phosphorylates uA --> pA
B dephosphorylates pA --> uA
B transcribes a
B synthesizes A
A is synthesized
B degrades A
A is degraded
Acyt translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus <--> Anuc


Examples:
current state:
[
A binds B <--> AB
AB phosphorylates C --> pC
pC is dephosphorylated --> C

prompt: The phosphorylated protein C exhibits kinase activity and phosphorylates its substrate D. Transcription factor D is then translocated into the nucleaus to transcribe E and F. After E and F are translated into G and H, respectively, they form a complex (denoted GH) and acquires phosphatase activity. GH dephosphorylates D, which completes a negative feedback loop. We also include the dissociation reaction of GH, which yields free G and H. It is assumed C and D are dephosphorylated at a certain rate.

new state:
[
A binds B <--> AB
AB phosphorylates C --> pC
pC phosphorylates D --> pD
pD is translocated to nucleus <--> pDn
pDn transcribes E
pDn transcribes F
E is translated into protein G --> G
F is translated into protein H --> H
G binds H <--> GH
GH dephosphorylates pD --> D
GH dissociates to G and H
pC is dephosphorylated --> C
pD is dephosphorylated --> D

prompt: In MedB-1 model IL13 binds to Rec and the resulting species IL13_Rec triggers the phosphorylation of JAK2. pJAK2 phosphorylates IL13_Rec that in turn also contributes to the phosphorylation of JAK2. pJAK2 phosphorylates STAT5 and pSTAT5 activates the transcription of target genes (CD274mRNA, SOCS3mRNA). The signal strength depends on Rec_i (receptor recycle), on p_IL13_Rec internalization and degradation and on the negative regulators SHP1, which de-phosphorylates pJAK2 and pSTAT5, as well as SOCS3, which is translated from SOCS3mRNA and inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK2. IL13 can also bind to DecoyR, forming the complex IL13_DecoyR without contributing to JAK2/STAT5 signaling. In the L1236 model SOCS3mRNA, SOCS3 protein, DecoyR and the associated reactions are not present.
